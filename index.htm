      <p>BADCamp is a technology conference for the people, an annual celebration of the open-source web and the creators who make it all possible. Join us this fall for four days of talks, trainings, summits, sprints and socials with some of the brightest minds from all over the world.</p>
      <p>BADCamp is inclusive, diverse, free, and most importantly, open to all. It's a place where beginners take first their steps, experienced veterans learn something new, creatives find fresh inspiration, and where like-minded people can meet friends old and new.</p>
      <p>This year BADCamp returns to the campus of UC Berkeley, easily accessible to multiple airports, hotels, and major public transit lines.</p>
      <p>Registration and session proposals will open soon. We look forward to seeing you in Berkeley this November!</p>
